# Infant Vision Simulator

A simulation tool designed to model and analyze infant vision capabilities. This repository contains the necessary scripts, configurations, and utilities for studying visual perception in infants.

## Features
- Simulation models for infant vision processing.
- Configurable datasets and transforms for visual inputs.
- Easy-to-use scripts and utilities for analysis.

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Core source code for the simulation models.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for running simulations and analyses.
- `dataset/`: Dataset files and loaders for vision data.
- `transforms/`: Image transformation utilities.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/usmanklodhi/InfantVisionSimulator.git
      cd InfantVisionSimulator
   ```
2. Install the package using `setup.py`:
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Usage
1. Configure the simulation settings in `config.py`.
2. Run the appropriate script from the `scripts/` directory.
