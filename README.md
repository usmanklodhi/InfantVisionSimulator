# Infant Vision Simulator

The Infant Vision Simulator is a computational tool designed to simulate and analyze infant vision capabilities. This project incorporates state-of-the-art techniques and training strategies, such as curriculum learning, to model and study visual perception in infants effectively.

## Features
- **Vision Simulation Models:** Advanced models to simulate infant visual perception.
- **Configurable Training Framework:** Supports hyperparameter customization and modular training workflows.
- **Dataset Support:** Easily integrates with various datasets for vision-related experiments.
- **Curriculum Learning:** Implements progressive training strategies to enhance learning efficiency and accuracy.
- **Visualization Tools:** Scripts to visualize transformed and processed images.

## Repository Structure
- `configuration/`: Configuration files for model hyperparameters and settings.
- `src/`: Core implementation of simulation and processing modules.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for analysis, benchmarking, and visualization.
- `my_datasets/`: Dataset loaders and sample datasets for training and testing.
- `transforms/`: Image transformation utilities tailored for visual perception studies.
- `training/`: Comprehensive training modules, including curriculum learning and traditional methods.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/usmanklodhi/InfantVisionSimulator.git
   cd InfantVisionSimulator
   ```
2. Install the package using `setup.py`:
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Usage
1. Configure the simulation settings in the `configuration` folder.
2. Run training scripts from the `training/` directory. For example, to use curriculum learning:
   ```bash
   python training/curriculum_training.py
   ```
3. Use visualization tools in the `scripts/` directory to inspect and analyze results.
